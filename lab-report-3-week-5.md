 The command *grep -n* opion takes a pattern in "" and a file option after it and return all the lines that in file that contains the pattern with the prefix of line number added before the actual content of the line. This can be used if we the actual content of the file is really large. With the line number provided, we can easily locate where the content is.

./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:    The failure to find a primary radar return for American 77 led us to investigate this issue further. Radar reconstructions performed after 9/11 reveal that FAA radar 
equipment tracked the flight from the moment its transponder was turned off at 8:56. But for 8 minutes and 13 seconds, between 8:56 and 9:05, this primary radar information on American 77 was not displayed 
to controllers at Indianapolis Center.

Vice President was still on the phone with the President advising that three planes were missing and one had hit the Pentagon. We believe this is the same call in which the Vice President urged the President not to return to Washington. After the call ended, Mrs. Cheney and the Vice President moved from the tunnel to the shelter conference room.

The command option *grep -r* will recursively look through all the subdirecories and files under the given directory with out the needed to give the file path. This can be really useful if the directory has many subdirectories but we want to look through all the files in it. There is no need to write file path like *./technical/*/*/*/*/*/*/*.txt* but simply *./technical*.

*grep -v*

The command option *grep -i* will ignore the case distinction in both the pattern and file provided. It is pretty useful because the words at the beginning of a sentence have a captical letter. Using -i can help us avoid doing work such as *grep "this"* and *grep "This"*.
